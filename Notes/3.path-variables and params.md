# Path variables and Params in Spring

## Path variables

Path variable is use to get data from API url.
For example - http://localhost:8090/api/v1/customer/delete-customer/2
In above example we can get "2" / Id using params for future development

```
  @DeleteMapping(path = "delete-customer/{id}")
    public String deleteCustomer(@PathVariable("id") int customer_id) {
        String message = customerService.deleteCustomerById(customer_id);
        return message;
    }

```

## Params variables

This is same as path variable. basically we use this for searching.
For example - http://localhost:8090/api/v1/customer/get-one-customer?id=2
In above example we can get "2" / Id using params for future development

### method 1 :

```
    @GetMapping(path = "/get-one-customer")
    public CustomerDTO getCustomerByID (@RequestParam(name = "id") int id){} //we can use this as well for search

```

### method 2 :

```
  @GetMapping(path = "/get-one-customer", params = "id")
    public CustomerDTO getCustomerByID (@RequestParam(value = "id") int customerId){
        CustomerDTO customerDTO = customerService.getCustomerByID(customerId);
        return customerDTO;
    }
```
