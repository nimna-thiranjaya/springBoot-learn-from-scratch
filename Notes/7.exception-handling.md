# Exception Handling

We can use exception handing to handle exceptions such as NotFound, Conflict, Duplicate

## Step 01 :

Create new exception package in root folder and crete new class for exception that we are going to handle with relevant name.. after that we have to extend that class from RunTimeException class and config as follow

we use @ResponseStatus annotation to annotate relevant error status code. After that we can create constructor with message parameter and that message pass to parent contractor

```
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)
public class NotFoundException extends RuntimeException{
    public NotFoundException (String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
```

## Step 02 :

Now it display NotFound error without custom error message because it work like parent exceptions.. to avoid that we have to advise to if got this kind of exception pass this kind of standard output

Crete new package as advise in root folder and crete new class called AppWideExceptionHandler..in AppWideExceptionHandler we can advise to pass that kind of standard output for that relevant exception

```
    // For default any exception
    @ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
    public ResponseEntity<StandardResponse> handleException (Exception e) {
        return new ResponseEntity<StandardResponse>(
                new StandardResponse(500, "Error", e.getMessage()),
                HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR
        );
    }

    // For not found exception
    @ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class)
        public ResponseEntity<StandardResponse>  handleNotFoundException (NotFoundException e) {
            return new ResponseEntity<StandardResponse>(
                    new StandardResponse(404, "Error Coming", e.getMessage()),
                    HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND
            );
        }
```
