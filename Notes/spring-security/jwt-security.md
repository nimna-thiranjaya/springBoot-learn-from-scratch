# JWT Authentication

Before start to use JWT they use jSession token to authenticate users. jSession doesn't allow to store user data and if end user didn't close the browser session won't removed from browser. because of these issues developers move to JWT.

## Advantages of JWT

1. don't required to send credentials with api.
2. We can invalidate only token without user credentials
3. We can create token for short time period.
4. Can store details in token (User information/ role information)
5. reusability
